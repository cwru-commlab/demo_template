## Description
_The format of this portion will vary depending on the type of lesson. This example outline is based on a flight instruction lesson plan, but you can edit it as you see fit._

### Introduction
_Explain the value of the material. Example: A lesson planning template helps instructors to more easily convert curricular exercises into a standard format that others can adopt._

### Objectives
After this lesson the learner will be able to:
 - _Explain and demonstrate how to edit Markdown documents_
 - _Describe the value of a lesson template_
 - _Perform GitHub pull requests_

### Tips for Instructors
  - _Ensure that the student has a GitHub account and a working knowledge of version control_
  - _Replace these items with thoughtful considerations for people who may adopt your curriculum in the future._
  - _Include multiple students in the demo._

### Lesson Briefing
 - _List any textbook readings that are relevant._
 - _You may also want to add hyperlinks to pre-readings. These may include relevant standards, YouTube videos, or other resources._
 - _If applicable, replace or supplement the bulleted list with narrative information._

**Supplements**
 - _List any additional resources that may be of interest to the reader but are not strictly required for the demo._

### Equipment
_If the equipment list is more than 5 items or $20, list it in a BOM.csv file and link it here. Otherwise, a bulleted list here is sufficient._

## Demonstration
_If the demo is described in a PDF or other document, upload it to the repository and link it here. Otherwise, describe the demo step-by-step. Use embedded images as appropriate._

### Scenario
_<ins>**This approach may not apply for your lesson.**</ins> If it does not apply, delete this section._

_After a long delay sitting in a cold and humid warehouse, your interplanetary spacecraft is finally approved for launch!_

_It makes it all the way to Saturn, but when you try to deploy the high-gain antenna, the motor fails._

 - _How will you compensate for the failed antenna?_
 - _What could have prevented the failure?_

#### Case Studies
[_Galileo high-gain antenna problem, 1991._](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_project#High-gain_antenna_problem)

### Schedule
 - _Lesson Briefing (0:20)_
 - _Demonstrations and Practice (0:30)_
